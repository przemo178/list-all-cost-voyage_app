# ListAllCostVoyageApp
I wanted to create a simple web application to list all cost items related to a voyage. Focused on displaying and working with expense categories and cost Items only.
- Application built using TypeScript and have all data types created as TypeScript interfaces.
- Exchange Rate to base currency is available in costs.json file (baseCurrency.exchangeRate).
- Comments should be available to read by clicking on the comments icon. The comment icon should expand/collapse this section of comments.
- There is possible to change the main currency that is used to display costs. All available currencies with corresponding FX rates are listed in exchange-rates.json. Doing so, will recalculate the cost in DA Currency and display to the user. To do so, each individual cost item needs to be multiplied by the selected currencyâ€™s exchange rate.
- Costs rounded to two decimal points.
- Total section for each expense category displayed.
